| `ls [ip]` | List virtual directory contents on breached host (`/etc`, `/home`, `/data`) | Target file discovery & intel gathering |

| `overdrive` | Burn 2 CPU and 8% trace to stack +1 combo and +10 unbanked credits | Voluntary risk, combo priming & dopamine anticipation |
| `stance <mode>` / `proxy <ip>` / `quickhack <ip>` / `intel <reveal\|forge>` | Shift deck stance, route a proxy hop, instant-breach a tier 1-2 host, or spend threat intel | Tactical resource & risk modulation |
| `lay_low [1-3]` / `wait` | Ghost the connection for 1-3 turns: +1 CPU and up to -2% trace per turn while the grid keeps moving | Downtime recovery & shift-aware risk management |

| `story` | Show the current act, story log, and briefing | Narrative orientation & campaign immersion |
| `contract` / `bounty` | Open the job board: active job plus offers; `accept_job <id>` takes one, `drop_offer <id>` passes one for 30 CR or a one-turn cooldown, `decline_contract` abandons the active job | Job choice, clock & risk/reward |
| `tutorial` / `tips` | Show the first-run field manual with live scan, probe, breach, loot and extraction checkboxes | Onboarding & core-loop clarity |
| `rival` | Inspect the run's rival netrunner, stolen contract count, and next scheduled move | Peer-antagonist awareness |

| `quests` / `missions` | Open the mission board with progress, rewards, and available jobs | Goal clarity & Zeigarnik completion pressure |

| `contact <handle> [talk\|job\|favor\|ally\|defy]` | Talk to an operative, accept their job, spend a one-time favor, or make Agent Zero's Act III alliance choice | Character interaction & story branching |
| `accept <quest_id>` | Accept an available side quest from the mission board | Player-authored goals & autonomy |
| `cash_out` / `jackout` | Disconnect and bank all unbanked credits; trace 50%+ adds an ICE surge, and 85%+ can burn the run at the extraction point | Loss aversion & push-your-luck extraction |
| `shop` | Open the Black Market vendor for permanent hardware upgrades and one-use consumables such as the Dead Man's Switch | Anticipation of reward & meta-progression |
